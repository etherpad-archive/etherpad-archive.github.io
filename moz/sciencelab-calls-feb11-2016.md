Today's Topics: 
Open Science Media Makers
Slightly inspired by the multimedia Space Shuttle Challenger piece in PM (http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a18616/an-oral-history-of-the-space-shuttle-challenger-disaster/). Science Studio (http://thesciencestudio.org/), and RealScientists (http://realscientists.org/), projects that promote open science in media, or media about science. 

	* "If you're reading this, you belong"

		* https://twitter.com/RealSciMods
		*  
		*  
		* Comments? Questions?
			* Real Scientists inspired us to launch @CMSvoices: https://twitter.com/CMSvoices and http://cern.ch/cms-voices \o/
				* https://twitter.com/WetheHumanities and ???
			* How easy or difficult was it to recruit people initially? 
				* A: try to start 4 weeks ahead (good communicators, strong following). Not difficult at first.
			* Have you found over the years a shift in where scientists communicate? (ie., initially blog, now more twitter?) Any trends re: platform / style?
				* A: yes, trend towards twitter. There's almost a bit of a retreat, twitter is a demanding interface / can be hostile. Complementation with science blogs
			* I'm assuming contributors are international? What's the balance of nationalities / institute locations? Also, are you covering all science fields? Do you have filters for type, e.g. biomedical and life sciences filter? Thanks :)
				* A: trying to get as many nationalities as possible! Bias towards english. Some bilingual tweeters (spanish, bengali). Difficult to get ppl to sign up - ppl don't self select that easily, need to go after people personally. Wants to talk to African, sub-continental, south american scientists.
					* Curator map on the website: http://realscientists.org
			*   

		* Notes
			* Upulie - cofounded of realscientists, 3 years ago (2013). Rotational curation account for scientists = real scientists! twitter + email. Launched two weeks from inception. Give ppl a feel on what the science life is like. Showcase careers w/ a science degree (not just research!)
			* Twitter - inserting science into their day. People become interested when you present it in an accessible way.
			* Joined by science communicators, build website, give broad understanding on science careers.
			* Gratifying to see how ppl have responded.
			* Twitter - different person every week (broad view), and good engagement
			* Started to introduce more people, todo: data collection, engagement analysis. & looking at creative ways to deal with their website.
			* Want to showcase communicating science / storytelling

	* Adventures in Science Casting/Youtube Communities

		* Comments? Questions? 
			* April & Kurtis - as well as hearing scientists raves/rants, are you interested to hear about how eLife is trying to address these problems (i.e. from the industry end)? Perhaps as a response? Note eLife is a community initiative, including a journal - we are by scientists for scientists, so this isn't advertising
				* A: anybody that's involved in science incl. publishers. Involve
			* Made a PR updating the first episode's date: https://github.com/themethodpodcast/themethodpodcast.github.io/pull/1
			* Can you tell us more about "peer reviewed podcasting"? Seems like a meaty topic. Have there been any big challenges?
			* Who are you targeting with your new version of the Blog and Youtube channel? SWEET!!
			*  @kurtis: you might know my friend Sarah 
			*  
			*  

		* Notes
			* April: in Charlottesville Virgina, COS
				* Method Podcast - in the making! Coming out this coming summer.
				* Epidemiologist, creating radio for science for several years
				* met Kurtis @ opencon, want to make a podcast, not about scientific advances, but science as a system
			* Rant & Rave about innivations on how science is done
				* world's only peer reviewed podcast
				* collect rants & raves from scientists. Transcribed by one of them, brought into interview with someone else -- don't know who wrote the rant/rave, they comment on it. Result: conversation including some peer review abt someone's rant or rave on science
			* First seassons - peer review process, diversity, open data. Being put together soon
			* If you have a rant or a rave about anything you encounter in your life as a scientist, they would like to hear from you
				* Oh, man, this will be a long affair. +1
			* Kurtis: super excited for 'The Method'
				*  wearing a bunch of science communication hats. Private school science teacher in Vancouver, also works at Science World. Also communicates science in his space time - youtube&blog - the Scope of Science
				* Started blog on the process & how we communicate science. Did some of his own science communication, entered some contests talking about his research - super well received. Did 'Science Slam' -- make fun presentation of your research and spread to a general audience (like poetry slam)
				* In the process of rebooting Scope of Science channel -- decided to reboot to be specifically on scientific theories that aren't well heard about.
					* Gateway drugs to science: chaos theory, etc. 
					* for teens & 20s, interested in science but never really liked it in an academic environment. Spark that for them.
				* Tips for science videos! Getting research out to public! universities are looking for / giving attention to this lately
					* Ppl want you to it, and ppl want to watch it.
					* Easier than you think! Ppl will support you
					* Just need a webcam + software, talk to the camera like it's someone you know. Like your 5 yo niece / nephew

		* Richard Smith-Unna / University of Cambridge / @blahah404
			* Latest Blog: http://rik.smith-unna.com/2016/01/11/starting-to-sprint-with-slidewinder/
				* And another blog coming up later today as I've now finished the first sprint
				* Slidewinder is now a working prototype - a command-line tool and (more interesting) a web app for making and sharing slides and presentations
				* The webapp is in a live preview at http://app.slidewinder.io/
				* But note that it's an alpha - there will be bugs :). Feedback, bug reports and other discussion very welcome - please post issues https://github.com/slidewinder/app/issues
				* Or you can come chat to us at https://gitter.im/slidewinder/slidewinder
				* Next steps:
					* Improve the contributor documentation (http://slidewinder.io/docs)
					* Fix bugs
					* Put in place a roadmap for next features
				* My next sprint will focus on making better tools for teaching comptutational skills, building a more feature-rich platform from my command-line bootcamp: https://github.com/Blahah/command_line_bootcamp
