Today's Topics: 
Open Science Media Makers
Slightly inspired by the multimedia Space Shuttle Challenger piece in PM (http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a18616/an-oral-history-of-the-space-shuttle-challenger-disaster/). Science Studio (http://thesciencestudio.org/), and RealScientists (http://realscientists.org/), projects that promote open science in media, or media about science. 

	* "If you're reading this, you belong"
	Real Scientists / @realscientists (Upulie Divisekera)
		* http://realscientists.org/
		* https://twitter.com/realscientists
		* https://twitter.com/RealSciMods
		*  
		*  
		* Comments? Questions?
			* Real Scientists inspired us to launch @CMSvoices: https://twitter.com/CMSvoices and http://cern.ch/cms-voices \o/
				* https://twitter.com/WetheHumanities and ???
			* How easy or difficult was it to recruit people initially? 
				* A: try to start 4 weeks ahead (good communicators, strong following). Not difficult at first.
			* Have you found over the years a shift in where scientists communicate? (ie., initially blog, now more twitter?) Any trends re: platform / style?
				* A: yes, trend towards twitter. There's almost a bit of a retreat, twitter is a demanding interface / can be hostile. Complementation with science blogs
			* I'm assuming contributors are international? What's the balance of nationalities / institute locations? Also, are you covering all science fields? Do you have filters for type, e.g. biomedical and life sciences filter? Thanks :)
				* A: trying to get as many nationalities as possible! Bias towards english. Some bilingual tweeters (spanish, bengali). Difficult to get ppl to sign up - ppl don't self select that easily, need to go after people personally. Wants to talk to African, sub-continental, south american scientists.
					* Curator map on the website: http://realscientists.org
			*   

		* Notes
			* Upulie - cofounded of realscientists, 3 years ago (2013). Rotational curation account for scientists = real scientists! twitter + email. Launched two weeks from inception. Give ppl a feel on what the science life is like. Showcase careers w/ a science degree (not just research!)
			* Twitter - inserting science into their day. People become interested when you present it in an accessible way.
			* Joined by science communicators, build website, give broad understanding on science careers.
			* Gratifying to see how ppl have responded.
			* Twitter - different person every week (broad view), and good engagement
			* Started to introduce more people, todo: data collection, engagement analysis. & looking at creative ways to deal with their website.
			* Want to showcase communicating science / storytelling

	* Adventures in Science Casting/Youtube Communities

		* Comments? Questions? 
			* April & Kurtis - as well as hearing scientists raves/rants, are you interested to hear about how eLife is trying to address these problems (i.e. from the industry end)? Perhaps as a response? Note eLife is a community initiative, including a journal - we are by scientists for scientists, so this isn't advertising. Great! Can you hit me up? n.penfold@elifesciences.org? Or I can hit you up?
				* A: anybody that's involved in science incl. publishers. Involved in research outside of academia
				* A: Feel free to contact us at contact.the.method@gmail.com! We would love to chat. :)
				* Great, thanks! And good luck :D
```
			* Made a PR updating the first episode's date: https://github.com/themethodpodcast/themethodpodcast.github.io/pull/1 Thanks!
			* Can you tell us more about "peer reviewed podcasting"? Seems like a meaty topic. Have there been any big challenges? (also, love the phrasing :) )
				* K: we worry about bias in communication, and we talk about the sci process needing review, such a impt step. testing that out for science communication.
				* A: started off as an idea that would be a lot of fun, but also 
			* Who are you targeting with your new version of the Blog and Youtube channel? SWEET!!
				* A: Teens & 20s interested in science, but never liked it in an academic environment
			*  @kurtis: you might know my friend Sarah at Brainboost (she's the one that pointed me towards Moz!) Ha! It is a small world! I do :) - vancouver is a small place ;) Indeed!
			*  
			*  

		* Notes
			* April: in Charlottesville Virgina, COS
				* Method Podcast - in the making! Coming out this coming summer.
				* Epidemiologist, creating radio for science for several years
				* met Kurtis @ opencon, want to make a podcast, not about scientific advances, but science as a system
			* Rant & Rave about innovations on how science is done
				* world's only peer reviewed podcast
				* collect rants & raves from scientists. Transcribed by one of them, brought into interview with someone else -- don't know who wrote the rant/rave, they comment on it. Result: conversation including some peer review abt someone's rant or rave on science
			* First seassons - peer review process, diversity, open data. Being put together soon
			* If you have a rant or a rave about anything you encounter in your life as a scientist, they would like to hear from you 
				* contact.the.method@gmail.com
				* Oh, man, this will be a long affair. +1
				* Feelings
			* Kurtis: super excited for 'The Method'
				*  wearing a bunch of science communication hats. Private school science teacher in Vancouver, also works at Science World. Also communicates science in his space time - youtube&blog - the Scope of Science
				* Started blog on the process & how we communicate science. Did some of his own science communication, entered some contests talking about his research - super well received. Did 'Science Slam' -- make fun presentation of your research and spread to a general audience (like poetry slam)
				* In the process of rebooting Scope of Science channel -- decided to reboot to be specifically on scientific theories that aren't well heard about.
					* Gateway drugs to science: chaos theory, etc. 
					* for teens & 20s, interested in science but never really liked it in an academic environment. Spark that for them.
				* Tips for science videos! Getting research out to public! universities are looking for / giving attention to this lately
					* Ppl want you to it, and ppl want to watch it.
					* Easier than you think! Ppl will support you
					* Just need a webcam + software, talk to the camera like it's someone you know. Like your 5 yo niece / nephew
					* Here is a quick-tips video I made for a conference by a communications company a while ago (public now!) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L3iGIgVDMI Thanks!!
					* The best MOOC I've taken was Stanfords Writing in the Sciences, great for all science communicators: https://www.coursera.org/course/sciwrite

	* Science Journalism + Pop Media
	Emily Elert / MinuteEarth / @eelert
		*  https://twitter.com/MinuteEarth
		*  https://www.youtube.com/user/minuteearth < miniseries 
		*  http://journalism.nyu.edu/graduate/programs/science-health-and-environmental-reporting/ < science journalism
		* Comments? Questions? 
			* Hey, I studied Science Journalism too! :D People are still surprised that it exists as a field. A fellow science journalist! 
			* What story surprised you most? (Either in how it was received, content, fun twists)
				* A: wildfire management video -- backfired! wildfires are worse. Surprising and cool.
			* How tricky is coordinating an international team! How do you manage it?
				* A: quite tricky! Use slack as productivity/chat tool. All operating around the clock, but they can interact in way that feels closer to being in the same place. Being flexible with their schedule.
					* 7 people working on Minute Earth, though many are part time (Emily + an illustrator are full-time). 
					* Work on scripts for a long time - sometimes 5-9 drafts. Work to make the scripts as information dense as possible. Visuals help to build in additional information. 
			* Do you have a base website apart form Youtube channel talking about yourselves, project etc? ie a reference point
				* 
			*  Do you use any particular software to make the vids?
				* Yes – we use all the Adobe CC software for the actual video production and audio editing. Our illustrators draw on tablets and screencapture their drawing process; we then cut that video to match the narration. Great, thanks!

		* Notes:
			*  Minute Earth started March 2013, almost 3 years! //starts making a cake, to make up for that flub. :)🎂
			* Emily - trained as a science journalist. Science journalism is a real thing you can go to school for!
				*  Classical journalism training + science specific stuff
			* Science journalism - not a lot of news in science -- based on the journal publishing cycle. Press releases. Articles sometimes written totally off the press release. Emily - gravited away from that.
			* Minute Earth - created by Henry Reich (TY!) from minute physics -- got really popular on youtube. Draws pictures and talks quickly about physics - 2-3min explainers. Minute earth was bringing the same treatment to Earth science. Mix of more agenda driven stuff, science policy videos. 
				* Henry Reich is behind https://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics
			*  Small team, mostly scientists, Emily is the only science journalist. 7 ppl. 2 illustrators. International -- India, venezuela, cambodia, mtg times are challenging.

				* And another blog coming up later today as I've now finished the first sprint
				* Slidewinder is now a working prototype - a command-line tool and (more interesting) a web app for making and sharing slides and presentations
				* The webapp is in a live preview at http://app.slidewinder.io/
				* And I made a small command-line tool to generate slides from figures in the open-access literature: https://github.com/slidewinder/open_access_figures
				* But note that it's an alpha - there will be bugs :). Feedback, bug reports and other discussion very welcome - please post issues https://github.com/slidewinder/app/issues
				* Or you can come chat to us at https://gitter.im/slidewinder/slidewinder
				* Next steps:
					* Improve the contributor documentation (http://slidewinder.io/docs)
					* Fix bugs
					* Put in place a roadmap for next features, including:
						* share slides/decks, and use or remix other people's slides/decks
						* build in the 'slides from figures' feature so you can search for a paper/doi/keyword and generate slides from the results
				* My next sprint will focus on making better tools for teaching comptutational skills, building a more feature-rich platform from my command-line bootcamp: https://github.com/Blahah/command_line_bootcamp
				* PhD student at Cambridge studying photosynthesis
				* Fellowship: focusing on little bits of science that are irritating, come up with small technical solutions
			*  Comments? Questions?
				*  Do you plan to have a visual composer for slidewinder? 
					* Currently in MarkDown. Its planned to have a WYSIWYG Editorface
					* 
				*  Is there a way of tracking reuse of OA figures? i.e. as a measure of success of OA?
					* yes! both slides and decks will have social features like favourites, remixes and tracking of metrics
				* Is remixing by CC-BY? Thanks :)
					* A: CC-BY-4.0 by default
