Updates from Tech Speakers:   (2 - 3  min each) 
	* Yuli sharing on her recent experience speaking back-to-back 

	* Rabimba on Mixed Reality Workshop
		* https://on.tchspk.rs/oscon2018
		* Currently in OSCON on echo-y room
		* Having a great experience with a new slide system that helps engage the audience as it contains remixable content which can be activated on the spot by selecting a "remix on glitch" link.
		* this can make the talk have a workshop feel as the audience is not longer under a passive experience but is able to activelly play with the content.
		* Unfortunatelly glitch requires an internet connection which can lead to frustration in venues where the network is bad.
		* indeed it's a recurrent problem, PWA and own server helps but it's annoying to do web based workshop... without a proper connection. Especially since some of the power of AFrame comes from community based component, ability to load remote assets, etc
			* could also check https://github.com/digaverse/webxr-webpack-boilerplate I know the author is an active AFrame contributor and is eager to improve his tool to provide for better workshops +1+1

Questions (Please add your questions, ideas, additional thoughts. We may not be able to respond to all in real time/at this call. We'll follow up as best we can.)
	* 
		* Question: how does Flaki can be sooooo thin if he survives on plane food? Is he taking the chicken or the pasta? how does that work?
			* Rumour has it, he only eats plane food. While flying. That's why he *has to* travel this much, it's a self-sustenance thing, otherwise he'd starve.
			* 🤔 makes sense to me, maybe his metabolism just work on a certain altitude above 5km
