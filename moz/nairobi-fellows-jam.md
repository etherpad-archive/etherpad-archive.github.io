			* Steph contacted through Airbnb 6/2.  Note: They only have 2 single rooms.  Asked for quote for 2 singles and 4 doubles.  They also state a 3 night minimum stay policy.  I asked if we could stay only 2 nights.  Pinged again 6/3, still no response on quote. <- I can stay in our place if it helps lighten the load - possibly we can have some people there too? Will check.

TRANSPORTATION:
    * KT is going to investigate getting drivers for the week
    * Uber is working really well
    * Look into arranging drivers for to/from airport
    * Look into arrangements for drive to Brackenhurst
		
PREPARATION:
    Health
		You might want to visit a travel doctor prior to your trip, to consult on your immunizations
		Most inoculations are not required for travel to nairobi but if you venture outside the city (and we will) you should have them:
			* Tetanus
			* Hepatitis (A and B)
			* Typhoid
			* Yellow Fever <- still officially recommended but no cases since 1993
				* Just an FYI, doc at my travel center said no need for where we'll be.  Take that as you will.
			* Malaria Prescription :   http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/drugs.html
				* Recommendations from CDC for Kenya: http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/country_table/k.html
				* malarone is the more effective, more expensive one that can make some peeps psychotic
					* CDC says this one DOESN'T make you psychotic
				* doxycycline is very cheap and also highly effective but there is some resistance 
		Consider purchasing short-term travel insurance to complement these inoculations
		Emergency #s in Kenya: http://www.kenya-information-guide.com/ac-power-in-kenya-and-health-emergency.html#emerservices
		
    Visas
		You can purchase visas at the border, for about $50 american, I would recommend investigating getting it ahead of time to save the hassle
		Register with the Embassy of your home country, in preparation for your trip: (for example) << how long will it take me to get a Visa? how soon do I need to start the process?
		http://nairobi.usembassy.gov/enrolsmarttravel.html
		Check to make sure you need a visa here: http://www.kenyaembassy.com/visa.html
		Apply to get a visa at your nearest Kenyan consulate: http://www.kenya-information-guide.com/kenya-visa.html
			You will likely want a "Single Entry" or "East Africa Visa" if you are planning to travel to multiple countries in East Africa
			MSL will reimburse you any fees which you can direct through expensify
		Electronic visa option: http://evisa.go.ke/evisa.html - you can skip the longer line at the airport by printing it out in advance
		At arrival in Nairobi, you'll need:
			* Valid Passport
			* Arrival and Return Ticket
			* Adequate Funds (I recommend getting some money changed before you arrive in Kenya, as ATMs aren't always reliable/at the airport
			* Visa (if required)

    Packing
		Kenya is a tropical climate, you should bring layers and consider covering your body where possible to avoid (if nothing else) mosquitos
		It's pretty hot in July/August but temperatures drop drastically in the evening << add temperature range? 
		July: highs in high 70s F, daytime average around 71 F, nightime average around 55F, lowest lows of 51F according to this: https://weatherspark.com/averages/29277/7/Nairobi-Kenya
		Don't forget the following (I recommend a carry-on with dupes in case of lost luggage):
			* Comfortable, lightweight, and casual clothes (if you extend your stay for a safari, neutral is best, bright and bold is not)
			* Comfortable shoes or boots
			* Sunscreen
			* Insect repellent
			* Prescription medication
			* Sunglasses (if you're light sensitive, they're not cheap to purchase once you arrive, surprisingly)
			* Travel documents - passport, visa, others
			* Vaccination Certificates
			* Insurance Documents
			* Credit / Debit cards
			* Some cash (Kenya shilling (KSHS) or KES)
			* Sandals or flipflops
			* Kenya maps - city/town maps and travel guides

     Protocol
			* Ask people before you take pictures of them 
			* Watch your money, when exchanging currency you do so in a reputable hotel, foreign exchange bureau or bank.
			* Don't bother bringing valuables/jewelry
			* Where neutral clothes where possible
			* It's not safe to drink tap water, drink bottled even though it feels way wasteful
			* Tipping is OK although not mandatory in most places.
			* Walk / drive / move around w/ a buddy
			* Any suggestions about money belts or other ways to conceal money or other valuables?
			* Where to store passports for saftey-- carry on person at all times? Leave in hotel?
			* >>these http://www.mark.co.ke/2011/05/10-dos-and-donts-when-travelling-to-nairobi/ might be outdated, but some mention of rush hour traffic, smoking prohibitions, negotiating taxi prices, etc might be helpful
			* don't pick up taxis on the street - uber is great there

	Technology
			* Tmobile has free global data, it should work, I recommend speaking to your phone provider if you'd like data throughout the trip
				* locally the Safaricom network has amazing 3G coverage and speed almost everywhere I tried to use it
			* how widely available or reliable is wi-fi, speeds, what to expect
					* Not widely available but some caf√©s have it, the places we will be working should have it, the places we will be staying will probably have it but it probably won't work
			* any special converters or chargers needed for devices?
				* Voltage: 220-240 Volts (U.S./Canada are 110-120 Volts)
				* Adapter: http://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/kenya/ <- it's the UK plug/voltage system, so if you have a UK adapter that will work
