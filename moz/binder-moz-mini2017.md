final version
Objectives:
Our objective is to increase the number of people publishing educational, journalistic, and scientific materials that enable readers to read, edit, re-run and re-use that content. We believe Binder is the tool to achieve this.

Activities:
We plan to create the material for a one-day workshop giving an introduction to the Binder project and the public mybinder.org service, and using it at three test events in Europe. These first events will allow the material to be trialed and improved, so creating a lasting curriculum and allowing others to run similar workshops. The workshops will serve educators, journalists and scientists who want to learn to use Binder to improve the accessibility, shareability and reusability of their work. The three workshops will be held in locations where we have local support: Cambridge, UK, Berlin, Germany and Lausanne, Switzerland. We will promote the events and materials within the wider python and R communities as well as research and open-data networks we have access to.

Outputs:
We will produce a tested schedule and content for a one day workshop on Binder. We will extend existing Binder training material and documentation to include content focused on users and newcomers to the community. We will create building blocks for sessions from which to assemble a workshop. The development of the material, schedule and planning of the events will happen publicly on GitHub. The community creating the materials will be recruited from experienced Binder contributors and members of the workshop target audience who are trail-blazers in their respective fields. This activity will provide them with ideas, a network and material to run their own events. All materials produced will be open source.

Outcomes:
The outcome of this project will be an increased number educators, journalists and scientists creating Binder ready repositories that will allow their students, readers and collaborators to start reading, editing, re-running, and re-using their content. By lowering the barriers to experimenting with published analyses, we will promote more open innovation, reproducibility of analyses and efficiency in being able to re-use existing methods. Workshop participants will leave knowing how to create a Binder ready repository for their project. People enthusiastic about Binder will meet like minded individuals, so growing the Binder community.





Please tell us what you aim to do (objectives), how you plan to do it (activities), whom it will serve and where, what you plan to produce or create (outputs), and what the impact will be (outcomes). Max 2500 characters. Deadline: 17 December 2017

Goals for the project should be clearly described and thoroughly documented.  They should be strongly correlated to outcomes and goals of the grant as stated in the RFP: 
	* All projects should specifically reflect priorities that enhance our broader community efforts toward open innovation, efficiency in regards to practicing open science (lower barriers, ease of use & integration, etc), and reproducibility (transparent research methods & results)).

Objectives:
Our objective is to increase the number of people publishing educational, journalistic, and scientific materials that enable readers to read, edit, re-run and re-use that content. We believe Binder is the tool to achieve this.

Activities:
We plan to create the material for a one-day workshop giving an introduction to the Binder project and the public mybinder.org service, and using it at three test events in Europe. 
These first events will allow the material to be trialed and improved, so creating a lasting curriculum and allowing others to run similar workshops. The workshops will serve individuals who are not yet aware of Binder or have used a Binder ready repository created by someone else and now want to use it for their own work. They will already have experience creating content that they want to share but want to learn about new ways of doing so and increasing the number of people who interact with their material. The three workshops will be held in locations where we have local support: Cambridge, UK, Berlin, Germany and Lausanne, Switzerland. We will promote the events and materials within the wider python and R communities as well as research and open-data networks we have access to.

Outputs:
We will produce a tested schedule and content for a one day workshop on creating "Binders". We will extend existing Binder training material and documentation to include content focused on users and newcomers to the community. We will create building blocks for sessions from which to assemble a workshop based on who is attending.

The development of the material, schedule and planning of the events will happen in the open on GitHub. The community creating the materials will be recruited from experienced Binder contributors and members of the workshop target audience who are the trail-blazers in their respective communities when it comes to trying out new technology. This activity will provide them with ideas, a network and material to run their own events. All materials produced will be open source.

Outcomes:
The outcome of this project will be an increased number educators, journalists and scientists creating Binder ready repositories that will allow their readers to start experimenting with the content of the repositories. This in turn will promote more open innovation, reproducibility of analyses and efficiency in being able to re-use existing methods. Workshop participants will leave knowing how to create a Binder ready repository for their project. People enthusiastic about Binder will meet like minded individuals and network, so growing the Binder community.







Many visualisations and apps allow the user to explore a dataset but are themselves hard to inspect. It is like looking under the bonnet of a modern car: you see polished covers requiring specialist tools. We want to increase the sharing of less polished content were the reader can easily open the bonnet and sees the engine. Getting to work modifying and tweaking straight away.

We aim to increase the number of people publishing educational, journalistic,
and scientific materials that encourage readers to explore and re-use that
content. Many visualisations and apps allow the user to explore a dataset but
are themselves hard to inspect. It is like looking under the bonnet of a modern
car: you see polished covers requiring specialist tools. We want to increase
the sharing of less polished content were the reader can easily open the bonnet
and sees the engine. Getting to work modifying and tweaking straight away.

We will create a playbook and materials for running a one day workshop introducing
people to the Binder project and the public mybinder.org service. We will test
drive and improve these materials by running two events in Europe. We will
promote the events and materials within the wider python and R community, as
well as research and open-data networks we have access to. Trying out new tools
is a daunting task: you need to schedule time and getting answers to your many
small questions via async methods introduces a timelag. A workshop that gathers
experienced users and newcomers provides a timeboxed slot and faster feedback
on those all important small questions.

The development of the material and schedule will happen in the open on GitHub.
The community creating the materials will be recruited from experienced binder
contributors and members of the workshop target audience who are the trail-blazers
in their respective communities when it comes to trying out new technology.
This activity will provide them with ideas, a network and material to run their
own events.
The target audience for the workshop are individuals who are not yet aware of
Binder or have used a binder created by someone else and now want to use it for
their own work. They will already have experience creating content that they
want to share but want to learn about new ways of doing so and increasing the
number of people who interact with their material. The two workshops will be
held in Cambridge, UK and Berlin, Germany where we have local support.

We will produce a tested schedule and content for a one day workshop on creating
"binders". We will extend existing binder training material and documentation
to include content focussed on users and newcomers to the community. We will
create building blocks for sessions from which to assemble a workshop based on
who is attending.

The outcome will be an increased number of educational, journalistic and
scientific materials that allow the reader to look under the bonnet and start
experimenting with them.
